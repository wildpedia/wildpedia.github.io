  "senses.did_you_know": "Did You Know?",
  "senses.applications": "Human Applications",
  "senses.echolocation.how": "Bats and dolphins emit high-frequency sound pulses and listen for echoes bouncing off objects. By analyzing the time delay, intensity, and frequency shift of returning echoes, they create a detailed 3D map of their surroundings — even in complete darkness.",
  "senses.infrared.how": "Pit vipers like rattlesnakes have specialized pit organs between their eyes and nostrils that detect infrared radiation (heat). These organs contain a membrane with thousands of heat-sensitive receptors, allowing them to 'see' the body heat of warm-blooded prey even in total darkness.",
  "senses.magnetic.how": "Animals like sea turtles and migratory birds have magnetite crystals or specialized proteins (cryptochromes) in their bodies that detect Earth's magnetic field. This built-in compass allows them to navigate thousands of kilometers during migration with remarkable precision.",
  "senses.electroreception.how": "Sharks and rays have hundreds of jelly-filled pores called ampullae of Lorenzini that detect the tiny electrical fields generated by the muscle contractions and heartbeats of other animals. This allows them to locate hidden prey buried in sand or murky water.",
  "senses.ultrasound.how": "Some animals can produce and detect sound frequencies far above the human hearing range (above 20 kHz). Bats use ultrasound up to 200 kHz for echolocation, while dolphins can hear up to 150 kHz, enabling precise detection of objects and communication.",
  "senses.polarized.how": "Many insects and cephalopods have specialized photoreceptors that can detect the polarization pattern of light. Bees use polarized light from the sky as a compass for navigation, while octopuses and mantis shrimp use it to detect transparent prey and communicate.",
  "senses.pressure.how": "Fish have a lateral line system — a series of fluid-filled canals with hair cells along their bodies that detect changes in water pressure and vibrations. Sharks and crocodiles have similar systems that sense the slightest water movements from nearby prey or predators.",
  "senses.chemical.how": "Many animals have extraordinary chemical detection abilities far beyond human taste and smell. Dogs have up to 300 million olfactory receptors (vs. 6 million in humans), snakes taste the air with their forked tongues, and ants communicate complex messages through pheromone trails.",
